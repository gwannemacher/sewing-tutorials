| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------: |
| Start with the fly flaps already incorporated into the left and right front pieces                                                                                         |      ![image](images/starting-pieces.png)      |
| Interface the fly flaps                                                                                                                                                    |        ![image](images/interfacing.png)        |
| Finish the edge of the left (from the back) piece (the right will be finished later)                                                                                       |          ![image](images/finish.png)           |
| Place pieces right sides together. Mark bottom of the fly and mark above about 3/8"                                                                                        |      ![image](images/mark-bottom-fly.png)      |
| Sew with basting stitch to first marking                                                                                                                                   |          ![image](images/basting.png)          |
| Start just a little below the end of the basting stitch. Backstitch and sew with normal stitch length all the way down.                                                    |       ![image](images/normal-stitch.png)       |
| Remember to press.                                                                                                                                                         |           ![image](images/press.png)           |
| Place zipper tape right side down on right of the pattern. Put the metal part of the tape around where the first marking is.                                               |     ![image](images/place-zipper-tape.png)     |
| Switch to zipper foot. Stitch down zipper tape.                                                                                                                            |  ![image](images/stitch-down-zipper-tape.png)  |
| Grab edge of free end of zipper tape (youtube link to timestamp: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNbrGVJfHZY&list=PLu1cm76qZgNLV24GBwBkkviuIuoVWReB7&index=35&t=549s)      |     ![image](images/grab-zipper-tape.png)      |
| Fold over and finger press                                                                                                                                                 |         ![image](images/fold-over.png)         |
| Open up and flip to the back                                                                                                                                               |       ![image](images/flip-to-back.png)        |
| Grab left side of the sandwich and flip (youtube link to timestamp: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNbrGVJfHZY&list=PLu1cm76qZgNLV24GBwBkkviuIuoVWReB7&index=35&t=549s)   |       ![image](images/left-sandwich.png)       |
| Stitch left side of zipper tape but this time not too close to the zipper                                                                                                  | ![image](images/stitch-left-not-too-close.png) |
| Flip back to front. Add markings for the curve. Make sure the metal stopper is above the stitch line.                                                                      |           ![image](images/curve.png)           |
| Start with backstitch and stitch the curve. Start from the bottom because it's easier (for me).                                                                            |       ![image](images/stitch-curve.png)        |
| Unpick the basting stitch from the top of the pants to the first mark that was made earlier.                                                                               |   ![image](images/unpick-basting-stitch.png)   |
| Attach fly guard to the right (from the back) fly. Not sure I like the way she did it in the video, try attaching it to the edge of the fly flap and finish them together. |                      TBD                       |
